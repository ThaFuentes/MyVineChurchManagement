# myvinechurchonline/app/builddb/banned_ips.py
# Full path: myvinechurchonline/app/builddb/banned_ips.py
# File name: banned_ips.py
# Brief, detailed purpose: Creates the banned_ips table for MariaDB.
# Tracks abusive IP addresses for blocking in guest submission routes.
# Primary key on ip_address (VARCHAR(45) to support IPv4/IPv6 and fix MariaDB TEXT PK limitation).
# Audit fields for who banned and reason.
# Safe schema evolution: adds missing columns via INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS.
# Isolated module – called from builddb.py during DB initialization.
# Fixes errno 150 by matching banned_by type (INT UNSIGNED) to users.id.
