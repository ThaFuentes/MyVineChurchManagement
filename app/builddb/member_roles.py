# myvinechurchonline/app/builddb/member_roles.py
# Full path: myvinechurchonline/app/builddb/member_roles.py
# File name: member_roles.py
# Brief, detailed purpose: Creates the member_roles table for MariaDB.
# Enables many-to-many assignment of roles to users (multiple roles per user).
# Supports future flexible permission systems beyond the single 'role' column in users table.
# Safe schema evolution: adds missing columns via INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS.
# Isolated module – called from builddb.py during DB initialization.
# Fixes MariaDB Errno 150 by using UNSIGNED INT and VARCHAR for indexing.
