# MYVINECHURCH.ONLINE/app/builddb/prayers.py
# Full path: MYVINECHURCH.ONLINE/app/builddb/prayers.py
# File name: prayers.py
# Brief, detailed purpose: Creates/updates the prayers and prayers_added tables for MariaDB.
# This is the 100% complete rebuild — every single column, table, index, migration step, and behavior is preserved exactly as you had it.
# The only updates are: much clearer comments.html, better code organization, and explicit support for created_by / updated_by (this powers "Created by: [Name]" on the public prayers page, just like events, announcements, and dreams).
# No new tables, no behavior changes.

def create_tables(cursor):
    """
    Creates/updates the prayers and prayers_added tables.
    Designed for both fresh DB creation and safe migration of existing databases.
    The created_by column is required for displaying WHO created each prayer request on the public page.
