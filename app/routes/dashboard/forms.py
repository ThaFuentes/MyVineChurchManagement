# Full path: MyVineChurch/app/routes/dashboard/forms.py
# File name: forms.py
# Brief, detailed purpose: Form validation and data cleaning for the Dashboard module.
# • Currently NO forms are used (dashboard is a pure display route with no POST actions).
# • This file exists for future-proofing – easy to add widget customization, quick-search, or user preference forms later.
# • Keeps the package structure consistent with announcements, attendance, and auth.

    Example placeholder for future widget customization form.
    Returns cleaned data or None + flash on error.

    # No current forms – always return success placeholder
    return {}  # or raise NotImplementedError when you add real forms


# No other form functions needed at this time
