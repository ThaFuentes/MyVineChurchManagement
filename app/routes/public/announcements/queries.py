# Full path: MYVINECHURCH.ONLINE/app/routes/public/announcements/queries.py
# File name: queries.py
# Brief, detailed purpose: Reusable database query functions specifically for the public Announcements section.
# Returns ONLY public + active records (with rich creator_name via LEFT JOIN).
# 100% rebuilt to match the public/events/queries.py and public/dreams/queries.py gold standard – uses a.* so all columns are available to views and templates.
