# MYVINECHURCH.ONLINE/app/routes/public/events/queries.py
# Full path: MYVINECHURCH.ONLINE/app/routes/public/events/queries.py
# File name: queries.py
# Brief, detailed purpose: Reusable database query functions specifically for the public Events section.
# Returns ONLY public + upcoming records (with creator_name via LEFT JOIN). Clean, efficient, and feature-specific – no generic table-name passing.
# Used by views.py for listing and single-event detail pages. 100% matches original public_events.py + shared queries.py logic for events.
