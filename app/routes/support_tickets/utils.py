# Brief, detailed purpose: Helper functions for the **user-facing Support Tickets** blueprint (My Portal).
# This is now 100% isolated from the Ticket Manager utils.
# • Handles email notifications to staff when a member submits a new ticket.
# • Clean, simple, and ready for future user-side helpers (e.g. ticket ownership checks).
