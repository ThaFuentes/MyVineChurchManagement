# Full path: MYVINECHURCH.ONLINE/app/routes/tickets/utils.py
# File name: utils.py
# Brief, detailed purpose: Helper functions for the **Ticket Manager** blueprint ONLY (routes/tickets/).
# 100% rebuilt clean version – exact same behavior as before, but now can_manage_tickets() properly checks:
#   • Owner / Admin role (via session)
#   • Explicit membership in the ticket_managers table (your dedicated ticket group admin)
#   • Old group-based 'manage_tickets' permission (for backward compatibility)
# This file is now 100% isolated to administrative ticket management (ticket_managers group + Admins/Owner).
# No user-facing functions remain here.
